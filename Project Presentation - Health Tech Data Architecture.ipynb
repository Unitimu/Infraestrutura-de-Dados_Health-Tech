    "# Presentation - Health Tech Data Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "#### Develop all necessary infrastructure so that data generated by a chatbot, called Lumia, can be accessed by data analysts to develop dashboards that can answer business team questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lumia skills:\n",
    "1. scheduling\n",
    "2. consultation of medical insurance coverage\n",
    "3. information about preparation for procedures and exams\n",
    "4. returns results and reports\n",
    "5. evaluation of the experience\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What was possible to infer:\n",
    "1. the bot is already connected to a database, as some of these capabilities require it.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. the bot captures information such as the patient's personal data and desired exam\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusions:\n",
    "1. It will not be necessary to perform ETL between the bot and the database, since these functionalities require connection to a DB.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. Therefore, my work will be to perform transformations according to the demand of analysts, ~maybe needing to take the data to a data mart.~ but since I don't know what architecture the company is using, I will set up a data lake, a data mart and the pipeline to orchestrate all the data.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. __Lumia information that may be useful to data analysts:__\n",
    " 1. __Scheduling       ->__ value moved by medical area, number of appointments scheduled by area and age range of users. What are the most sought-after times?\n",
    " 2. __Evaluation       ->__ Are they giving feedback? What score are they giving for the experience?\n",
    " 3. __Results/Reports  ->__ How many patients are using this tool? Is there variation in the use of the tool by area?\n",
    " 4. __General          ->__ What is Lumia being used for? When are they using the tool?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It is noticed that all information is generated by the bot itself, so I will consider that everything I will take to the data mart is in just one database.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 4.1. I thought about the desire to compare the use of Lumia with traditional means of communication in a hospital/clinic, but after doing a more in-depth research on the company in question, I realized that much is said about BI, so I believe this analysis must have already been performed by another team.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. As I do not have the expertise to develop a bot in Azure, I will simulate the return that the bot produces through JSON files that a Python script will produce."

    "## Explanation of the technologies used\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Azure Cosmos DB (API NoSQL):__ a database for semi-structured data, with high availability so that the team responsible for Lumia can monitor the data produced by it almost in real time.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. __Copy data:__ the bronze layer of a data lake should store the data in the most raw form possible, so I used this Azure Synapse tool because I did not want to change the data in any way at this stage, only replicate it. <br><br>\n",
    "3. __Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2:__ an Azure technology that is low-cost and able to store structured and unstructured data, ideal for the bronze layer of a data lake.<br><br>\n",
    "4. __Data Flow:__ used to perform some data treatments according to the company's standards, such as column names in 'snake case' format and dates in 'datetime' format.<br><br>\n",
    "5. __Dedicated SQL Pool:__ for the silver layer and data mart, I used this Azure technology to store structured data to enable fast and robust insights.<br><br>\n",
    "6. __Stored Procedures:__ used for more complex transformations and to allow code maintenance if necessary. I used this technology for the last stage of the pipeline, since SQL is an extremely common language among data engineers, which would facilitate maintenance if another team were involved. <br><br>\n",
    "7. __Power BI:__ an accessible and possibly the most used tool for dashboard development. I took into account the question of maintenance by third parties."
